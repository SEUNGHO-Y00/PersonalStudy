1.2 Finding & Researching Behavior

1.3 Translating A Behavior Into A Tactic
* Tactic
  - Reconnaissance
  - Resource Development
  - Initial Access
  - Execution
  - Persistence
  - Privilege Escalation
  - Defense Evasion
  - Credential Access
  - Discovery
  - Lateral Movement
  - Collection
  - Command and Control
  - Exfiltration
  - Impact

1.4 Identifying Techniques or Sub-Techniques
* Key Strategies = Review, Search, Assess

1.5 Mapping to a Narrative Point

1.6 Hedging Your Biases
* Strategies
  - Collaborate
  - Adjust & Calibrate
  - Diverse Sources
  - Prioritize the Known

2.1 The Process of Mapping from Raw Data

2.2 Identify & Research Behaviors

2.3 Translate Behaviors to Tactics, Techniques & Sub-Techniques

2.4 Raw Data to Narrative Reporting

3.1 Storing & Displaying ATT&CK Mapped Data

3.2 Expressing & Storing ATT&CK-Mapped Data

3.3 Analyzing ATT&CK-Mapped Data 

3.4 Exercise 3 - Comparing Layers in ATT&CK Navigator

4.1 The Defensive Recommendations Process

* Step 0. Determine Priority Techniques

4.2 How Techniques & Sub-Techniques are Being Used

* Step 1. Research how techniques are being used
* Step 2. Research defensive options related to the technique

4.3 Researching Organizational Capabilities & Constraints, Determining Trade-Offs

* Step 3. Research organizational capability/constraints
* Step 4. Determine what tradeoffs are for org on specific options

4.4 Making Defensive Recommendations

* Step 5. Make recommendations
* Exercise Review
  - What resources were helpful to you finding defensive options?
  - What kind of recommendations did you end up making?
  - Did you consider doing nothing or accepting risk?
  - Were there any options that were completely inappropriate for you?

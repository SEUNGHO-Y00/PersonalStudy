# Clout Defender

This analyst unraveled a targeted phishing and social engineering attack against a rising influencer. Through OSINT, phishing analysis, and log forensics, they uncovered how personal details shared on social media were exploited to compromise her accounts. Using Kusto Query Language (KQL), they analyzed employee logs, inbound and outbound traffic, and passive DNS data to trace the attackerâ€™s steps and infrastructure. This exercise strengthened skills in threat analysis, digital forensics, and understanding the real-world risks of oversharing online.

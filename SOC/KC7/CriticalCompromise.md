# Critical Compromise (ICS)

This analyst completed the Critical Compromise in Chicago module, demonstrating their ability to investigate a malware-based attack on a SCADA system. Through their use of Kusto Query Language (KQL), they uncovered the deployment of malicious software that disrupted the power grid. Their investigation helped identify the attack's origin and provided insights into the attackersâ€™ methods, ultimately contributing to the restoration of normal operations and improving defenses for critical infrastructure.

* Nmap
  - Network Mapping: Identifying hosts in a network, including servers, routers, switches, and mobile devices.
  - Operating System Detection: Recognizing the operating systems running on network devices, including their version and uptime.
  - Service Discovery: Identifying services, applications, and their versions running on hosts.
  - Security Auditing: Detecting vulnerable software versions.
  - Scripting: Utilizing Nmap's Scripting Engine (NSE) to automate interactions with the target.
